#no_outline[= Gratitude]

I want to thank my first teacher, my amazing mother.

Always in gratitude to the three kayas as Drolkar, inner teacher Sangyé Menla,
and outer teacher Guru Padmasambhava.

I have been very humbled to have had truly realized teachers along my path and would like to mention a few.
HH Dalai Lama, HE Garchen Rinpoche, HH Mingyur Rinpoche, who gave me very precious empowerments and teachings.
HH Penor Rinpoche, who gave me my first empowerments and connection with Dharma.
His students and realized Dzogchenpas were my teachers for many years, so I want to say thank you to
HH Karma Kuchen, Khenchen Tsewang Gyatso, Gyatrul Rinpoche, His Eminence Khentul Gyangkhang Rinpoche,
Tulku Dawa Gyalpo, Khenpo Tenzin Norgay, and the Palyul lamas.
Deep appreciation goes to Venerable Lama Karma Dorje, who gave blessing and inspired me to teach the highest yana.

Without our very special group of practitioners, this text would not have happened.
They were the basis for this approach coming together, but many also helped with putting together this book.
So I'd like to also sincerely thank Dorje Lekpa, Masam Chönyi, Ösal Long-gyé, Nyimé Yeshé, Scott, Makye, and Yeshe.
