Now the four togal visions have reversed since awareness is "taking over."
Visions 4, 3, and 2 are in this phase.
This phase may also correspond with bhumis 2-10, unfolding non-linearly.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== #todo([Key Point])
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The key point in phase 3 is pure effortless abiding as self-liberation.

The practitioner has familiarized with effortless abiding without the need
for any other practices. With this comes self-liberation of conditioning and
the revelation of enlightenment.

  Listen: this is how to apply the teaching.\
  Do not go against what you do,\
  Because doing and not doing are unborn.\
  By [recognizing] this, whatever you do is the unborn reality. // Source says "knowing".

=== #todo([The Third Mode of Liberation TODO: Different title?])
The three modes of liberation are taking place naturally, and one
enters into the stream of nirvana for the natural exhaustion of conditioning.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, _The Way of Abiding_ @way-of-abiding])[
  Whatever appears and whatever arises,\
  all things that proliferate and abide as dynamic expressions of awareness---such
  as the five emotional poisons---no matter how they arise, even as they do so
  there is recognition, perfection of their dynamic energy, and their natural
  fading, leaving no trace.

  In atiyoga, great perfection,\
  it is said that there is no fruition to achieve.\
  The fruition is not created, but occurs naturally.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== #todo([Discerning the Implications])
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The implications are that conditioning is allowed to be freed in its own place.
Due to a lack of effort, there is a lack of karma.
The ultimate implication is that one becomes free of karma altogether,
unbinding from conditioned existence.

  I relaxed momentarily\
  within great, empty awareness free from limitations,\
  the space of purity and evenness.\
  And like a dream,\
  that confused appearance faded into basic space.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Jigme Lingpa @lotsawa-vajra-verses])[
  Rigpa has always been free from conceptual elaboration.\
  Conventions such as 'view', 'meditation' or 'conduct' and\
  Any clinging to them is cleared, without basis or origin.\
  Good thoughts, bad thoughts, and those in between,\
  Without slipping into any such categorization,\
  Are freed upon arising, without any agent to make distinctions.\
  As long as awareness does not lose its own ground,\
  There is no need for anything more than this.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Once karmic cycles are liberated, the enlightened mind is revealed.
This includes the four samayas and the five wisdoms in their full fruition.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Jigme Lingpa @lotsawa-vajra-verses])[
  Remaining genuinely is the dharmakaya,\
  Accompanying awareness is the sambhogakaya,\
  And the non-duality of stillness and movement is the nirmanakaya.\
  This is what we call the "three-kaya rigpa".

Commenting on the above lines by Jigme Lingpa:
#quote(block: true, attribution: [Yukhok Chatralwa Chöying Rangdrol @lotsawa-vajra-verses-commentary])[
  The first line refers to remaining genuinely in the uncontrived wisdom mind of primordial purity,
  in which phenomena dissolve, the natural state of the ground, beyond confinement and liberation.
  When this 'ordinary' state of awareness is recognized just as it is, without 'changing its fur'
  or 'altering its color', then, as it is untainted by apparent objects externally and unspoiled
  by the clinging mind within, that is direct realization of the wisdom of dharmakaya, rigpa-emptiness.
  The fact that the spontaneous radiance, which is unceasing and the ground out of which samsara and nirvana
  unfold, is not blocked, but arises, while we are aware of it, is what we call the sambhogakaya.
  Even though the expressive power (_rtsal_) of compassionate energy arises as objects, if thoughts vanish
  without trace, so that there is no opportunity for habitual tendencies to form, and arising and liberation
  occur simultaneously, then we come to master the great wisdom in which there is no division between
  stillness and movement. The ceaseless arising of the display from the king-like dharmakaya beyond
  transference is said to be the nirmanakaya. The "three-kaya rigpa" is what we call
  the inseparability of these qualities.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== #todo([Coming to the Decisive Conclusion])
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Effortlessness is the ultimate remedy.
One has full confidence in self-liberation. The evidence has presented itself
in the lack of conditioning. So one continues to release and trust until the
appearance of an inversion occurs. What was once self-liberating is now seen
as pure luminosity within a threshold.

This is pure Dzogchen, non-meditation.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_Kunjed Gyalpo_ @treasure-trove])[ // p.121
  I have revealed that there is no view to cultivate in meditation.\
  I have revealed that there is no samaya to uphold.\
  I have revealed that there is no enlightened activity involving effort.\
  I have revealed that three are no paths to traverse.\
  I have revealed that there are no levels of realization to determine.\
  Timeless awareness does not entail concepts and involves no specific conduct.\
  The true nature of phenomena, just as it is, cannot be contrived.
