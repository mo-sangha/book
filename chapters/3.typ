= Pure Effortlessness

Like knowing you have always been at the top of a mountain, there is a release into
what has always been here: purely present awareness.
Like letting a fire die out by itself, we can now allow mental/emotional conditioned patterns,
including the root pattern of egoic apprehension, to exhaust.
Previously, we were orientated into the fire, but now we are like space itself in which the fire is burning.
Pure effortless abiding is accompanied by constant self-liberation or self-harmonization.
Now the very mind which was seeking is allowed to invert as awareness, non-dual mind.

In regards to the elements and reality itself, now the four togal visions have reversed and
awareness is beginning to saturate body, speech, mind, and reality as it was once known.
Togal visions four, three, and two are in this phase.
This phase may also correspond with bhumis 2-10 and the jhanas, unfolding non-linearly.

== Key Point
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The key point here is that insubstantiality/emptiness is revealed, conditioned self with all its patterns
is liberated in its own place, like a piece of ice melting back into a lake.
The eight consciousnesses and five elements turn to five non-referential aspects of pure mind,
known as the five wisdoms.

  In atiyoga, great perfection,\
  it is said that there is no fruition to achieve.\
  The fruition is not created, but occurs naturally.
]

Referentiality is being allowed to subside as the way of abiding, free of karmic conditioning.
Here the discernment between purity and conditioning is a stark contrast, like knowing whether the hand
is making a fist or not.
Liberation is allowed to naturally take place in the face of non-doing.
Like a flower slowly being illuminated by the sunrise, the practitioner is taken
into complete freedom as awareness fully dawns.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, _The Jewel Ship_ @you-are-the-eyes-of-the-world])[
  Listen: this is how to apply the teaching.\
  Do not go against what you do,\
  Because doing and not doing are unborn.\
  By knowing this, whatever you do is the unborn reality.
]

The key point in phase three is pure effortless abiding as self-liberation.
The practitioner has familiarized with effortless abiding without the need for any other practices.
With this comes self-liberation of conditioning and the revelation of enlightenment.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, _The Way of Abiding_ @way-of-abiding])[
  Whatever appears and whatever arises,
  all things that proliferate and abide as dynamic expressions of awareness---such
  as the five emotional poisons---no matter how they arise, even as they do so
  there is recognition, perfection of their dynamic energy, and their natural
  fading, leaving no trace.

== Discerning the Implications
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Now we're in the context of total luminosity being exposed as enlightenment.
The implications are that conditioning is allowed to be freed in its own place.
Due to a lack of effort, there is a lack of karma.
The ultimate implication is that one becomes free of karma altogether,
unbinding from conditioned existence.
This can also be termed "cognitive diffusion" and serves as the basis for freedom.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Sera Khandro @lotsawa-excellent-path])[
  I relaxed momentarily\
  within great, empty awareness free from limitations,\
  the space of purity and evenness.\
  And like a dream,\
  that confused appearance faded into basic space.
]

Part of natural confidence within awareness is that ineffability is embraced without a need for holding a view.
There's no meditation reference to hold or maintain and conduct is ensured naturally.
This is right view in the pure sense of the eightfold path, which is then accompanied by
effortless intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.
As the basis for confusion, conditioned agency is relieved and liberated within its own place.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Jigme Lingpa @lotsawa-vajra-verses])[
  Rigpa has always been free from conceptual elaboration.\
  Conventions such as 'view', 'meditation' or 'conduct' and\
  Any clinging to them is cleared, without basis or origin.\
  Good thoughts, bad thoughts, and those in between,\
  Without slipping into any such categorization,\
  Are freed upon arising, without any agent to make distinctions.\
  As long as awareness does not lose its own ground,\
  There is no need for anything more than this.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Embracing the Larger Scope
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

As karmic cycles are liberated, enlightened mind is revealed.
This includes the four samayas and the five wisdoms in their full fruition.
There can be a shift here, abandoning the identity we once knew for a known spaciousness
presenting itself as much more authentic and secure than we could have previously imagined.
The great triad of kayas are unionizing as pure presence.
Meaning, the energy of reality, including our own bodies, is realized as nirmanakaya.
The non-referential cognition is known as sambhogakaya residing in the great spaciousness of dharmakaya.
Just like we can witness in dreams, there is a co-emergence of cognition and appearances within space.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Jigme Lingpa @lotsawa-vajra-verses])[
  Remaining genuinely is the dharmakaya,\
  Accompanying awareness is the sambhogakaya,\
  And the non-duality of stillness and movement is the nirmanakaya.\
  This is what we call the "three-kaya rigpa".
]

Commenting on the above lines by Jigme Lingpa:
#quote(block: true, attribution: [Yukhok Chatralwa Chöying Rangdrol @lotsawa-vajra-verses-commentary])[
  The first line refers to remaining genuinely in the uncontrived wisdom mind of primordial purity,
  in which phenomena dissolve, the natural state of the ground, beyond confinement and liberation.
  When this 'ordinary' state of awareness is recognized just as it is, without 'changing its fur'
  or 'altering its color', then, as it is untainted by apparent objects externally and unspoiled
  by the clinging mind within, that is direct realization of the wisdom of dharmakaya, rigpa-emptiness.
  The fact that the spontaneous radiance, which is unceasing and the ground out of which samsara and nirvana
  unfold, is not blocked, but arises, while we are aware of it, is what we call the sambhogakaya.
  Even though the expressive power (_rtsal_) of compassionate energy arises as objects, if thoughts vanish
  without trace, so that there is no opportunity for habitual tendencies to form, and arising and liberation
  occur simultaneously, then we come to master the great wisdom in which there is no division between
  stillness and movement. The ceaseless arising of the display from the king-like dharmakaya beyond
  transference is said to be the nirmanakaya. The "three-kaya rigpa" is what we call
  the inseparability of these qualities.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Coming to the Decisive Conclusion
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Effortlessness is the ultimate remedy.
One has full confidence in self-liberation within the context of day and night.
Like a screen which can display the full cycle of day and night but also a full range of experiences,
mind is untouched by its own expression.

The evidence for a wider scope of being has presented itself in the lack of conditioning.
One continues to release and trust until the appearance of an inversion occurs.
The very mind abiding in awareness is seen as awareness.
What was once self-liberating is now seen as pure luminosity within a threshold.

This is pure Dzogchen, non-meditation.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_Kunjed Gyalpo_ @treasure-trove])[ // p.121
  I have revealed that there is no view to cultivate in meditation.\
  I have revealed that there is no samaya to uphold.\
  I have revealed that there is no enlightened activity involving effort.\
  I have revealed that there are no paths to traverse.\
  I have revealed that there are no levels of realization to determine.\
  Timeless awareness does not entail concepts and involves no specific conduct.\
  The true nature of phenomena, just as it is, cannot be contrived.
