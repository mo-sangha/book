// Familiarization: the Key Point (intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

The key point of familiarization is *the self-liberation of phenomena*.

Having recognized awareness through the pointing-out instruction, the practitioner
now begins stabilizing in that recognition through participation in the sangha,
particularly through the use of short sits repeated many times.

However, one continues experiencing ordinary disturbing thoughts and
emotions, such as confusion and anxiety, which seems to produce a distinction between
resting in awareness and being stuck in thought.

At this point, two primary obstacles typically emerge from confusion:

1. The habitual tendency to see thoughts as a problem.
2. The habitual tendency to want to apply antidotes to get rid of them.

It is actually these very tendencies themselves, born from confusion, that seem
to produce the temporary non-recognition of awareness, like clouds seeming to obscure the sky.
But the awareness-holder has already seen the sky: they have direct knowledge 
of the nature of thought as the nature of mind.
Again and again, when a thought arises and its nature is spontaneously recognized as awareness itself,
any grasping onto that thought is instantly released, and the seeming substance of the thought
loses all stickiness.
This simultaneous recognition-release is called _the liberation of phenomena_.

By gaining experiential familiarity with this intuitive recognition, confidence in awareness grows,
and the habit of applying the confused mind settles.
The practitioner gradually experiences a large reduction in disturbing thoughts, especially deep-rooted thoughts
that antidotes were unable to fully uproot.
Knowing now that resting in awareness is more useful than any possible antidote, the tendency of searching for
and applying antidotes naturally fades.

Initially, there may be a gap between the arising of a thought and the recognition of its nature.
During this initial phase, instructions such as _pointing yourself out_ are useful to recognize
the nature again and again.

With familiarization, that gap diminishes, such that there is eventually no longer any method to apply.
At that point, thoughts liberate simultaneously with their arising.
This is called _the self-liberation of phenomena_, because phenomena liberate themselves.

Confidence in awareness grows, experience resting in awareness grows, contentment grows,
until one is always resting in awareness during all phases of the day and night.
