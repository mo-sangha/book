Self-liberation is the key to liberation itself.

The practitioner adopts effortlessness as the primary remedy.
Within effortlessness, mental and emotional conditioning is allowed
to self-liberate within its own place.
This includes the conditioned self, which is the primary factor in cyclic existence.

Discerning self-liberation enhances natural confidence, leading into pure effortless abiding,
to include all four postures, day, and night.
