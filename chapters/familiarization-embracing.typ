Self-liberation is the key to liberation itself.

The practitioner adopts effortlessness as the primary remedy.
Within effortlessness, mental and emotional conditioning is allowed
to self-liberate within its own place.
This includes the conditioned self, which is the primary factor in cyclic existence.

Discerning self-liberation enhances natural confidence, leading into pure effortless abiding,
to include all four postures, day, and night.

  Learn to make this distinction between awareness and mind or thought;
  rely on the stability of the former and purify the latter.

  The essence of the techniques of taking illness, destructive emotion, the intermediate
  state, and confusion to enhance the path is simply to rest in the natural state.

  When I watch the thoughts as they arise,\
  The watcher vanishes.\
  I search for it but nowhere is it found.\
  Neither is the searcher seen---\
  There is just a freedom from conceptual elaboration.\
  There's no agent; there's no object of its action.

  When settling naturally and without contrivance, realization dawns.
  When maintaining that state, like the flow of a river, it dawns in full.
  Completely relinquish all forms of conceptual focus and grasping,
  and constantly settle in equanimity, O yogi!

  When something unwanted falls into your lap, you have a negative reaction,
  such as anger, dislike, envy, upset, irritation, anxiety, depression,
  mental anguish, or fear of death and rebirth.

  When such reactions arise as a display due to dynamic energy, identify them as such.
  Do not renounce them, indulge in them, refine them away, transform them, look at them,
  or meditate on them. Rather, rest spontaneously in the single, naturally settled state
  of evenness, free of the proliferation and resolution of conceptual frameworks.

  Mind as a pure expanse of space, in which things vanish naturally and leave no trace,
  arises with intensity from within, pristinely lucid.

  The nature of the variety of phenomena is non-dual,\
  Yet each phenomenon is beyond the limits of the mind.\
  The authentic condition as it is does not become a concept,\
  Yet it manifests totally in form, always good.\
  All being already perfect, overcome the sickness of effort\
  And remain naturally in self-perfection: this is Meditation.
