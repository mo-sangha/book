// The Three Modes of Liberation
#import "../template.typ": *


The Three Modes of Liberation are:

1. Liberation through recognizing the thought's nature,\ like recognizing an old friend in a crowd.
2. Liberation where the thought liberates itself, or self-liberation,\ like a snake untying its own knots.
3. Liberation of thoughts as dharmakaya, without benefit or harm,\ like a thief entering an empty house.

In the sangha, these are referenced using the shorthand:

1. Old friend
2. Snake untying
3. Thief in an empty house

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche explains the three modes as follows:

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, _Vajra Heart Revisited_ @vajra-heart-revisited])[
 1. When you start to think once again, getting involved in a new thought,
  since you have already recognized the nature previously, when you recognize
  the thinker, that is the point at which you are meeting someone with whom
  you are familiar. You should recognize the thought as it arises, so that it is
  liberated simultaneously with its arising.
  [...]
  Once you have caught the scent of it, then the thought is liberated upon arising.
  This is like meeting someone you already know; you do not doubt who he is.
  As soon as you see him, you know who he is. It is the same with a thought;
  when you recognize it, it is liberated. This is like the example of drawing
  on water. Recognition and liberation are simultaneous.
  [However, at first, there will likely be a delay between a thought's arising
  and that recognition.]

 2. As you grow more and more accustomed to this, when a thought moves, you have
  an immediate recognition of the nature, so there is no need to apply any
  technique at all. The thought is liberated by itself, just as a knot tied
  in a snake does not have to be untied by anyone, because it unravels by itself.

 3. Finally, the ultimate [mode] of liberation is like a thief entering an empty house;
  there is nothing to liberate and there is no liberator. This is called stability
  or perfection in training. A thief entering an empty house does not gain anything
  and the house does not lose anything. All thought activity is naturally liberated
  without any risk or gain whatsoever. That is the ultimate achievement and is,
  therefore, the third of the three [modes]. This is confidence in [self-]liberation.
