// _Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements_ expands on the statements:

// #quote(block: true, attribution: [Garab Dorje])[
//   In recognizing your own nature, you are introduced to the ground.
//   As in the meeting of mother and child, therefore, there is recognition that the site of freedom is unity.

//   In the knowledge that freedom is self-effectuating, you decide upon rigpa itself.

//   You decide that the stains will cleanse the stains, that thoughts will take care of themselves
//   without having to employ some other remedy. Since freedom comes from the ground itself,
//   this is what instils confidence.

//   Therefore, just as the snake itself uncoils its own knots, as the tendency for awareness
//   to be directed elsewhere fades away, you establish a foundation upon the ground itself.
// ]
