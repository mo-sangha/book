_Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements_ expands on the statements:

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Garab Dorje])[
  In recognizing your own nature, you are introduced to the ground.
  As in the meeting of mother and child, therefore, there is recognition that the site of freedom is unity.

  In the knowledge that freedom is self-effectuating, you decide upon rigpa itself.

  You decide that the stains will cleanse the stains, that thoughts will take care of themselves
  without having to employ some other remedy. Since freedom comes from the ground itself,
  this is what instils confidence.

  Therefore, just as the snake itself uncoils its own knots, as the tendency for awareness
  to be directed elsewhere fades away, you establish a foundation upon the ground itself.
