The implications are that we are becoming familiar with the view and effortless abiding,
which facilitates self-liberation.

Things are starting to liberate in its own place, and this serves as evidence
for self-liberation, building confidence in the practitioner.

  In atiyoga, great perfection,\
  there is no view, meditation, or conduct.\
  I have revealed this thoroughly, so keep it in mind.\
  With nothing needing to be done---nothing to achieve, no concerted effort or speculation---\
  the ultimate meaning of suchness itself has always been spontaneous perfection.\
  How could there be anything to do or any doing?

  Deliberate action misleads---look at the confusing appearances of samsara.\
  Effort corrupts---think about the machinations of suffering.\
  With virtue and harm, there is an uninterrupted flow of happiness and suffering.\
  Karma is reinforced, causing one to wander high and low through samsara.\
  There is no opportunity to escape the ocean of conditioned existence.

  Understand that ordinary confused mind---which is rooted in the nonrecognition of awareness,
  reifies sense objects as having identity, and is unable to "stay in one place" without being
  caught up in sense objects---is a confined space. And so forge the path with unobstructed,
  nonconceptual timeless awareness, free of ordinary consciousness that engages in thinking
  in terms of identity.
