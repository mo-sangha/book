// The first Key Point of the Recognition chapter: the nature of mind is Awareness.
#import "../template.typ": *

The nature of mind is the nature of all experiences and appearances.

The key point here is that the practitioner is pointed to awareness as the nature of mind:
the very nature of the 80 cognitive states, which include aversion (33), attachment (40)
and ignorance (7)---things like sadness, states of peace, fear, sensations
are all permeated by awareness.
But also, for the practitioner, the four foundations of mindfulness are permeated by awareness---emotions,
mental formations, the body and environment.

This phase corresponds with the 3rd of the 5 paths: "The path of seeing is the direct
perception of the truth of reality through nonconceptual samadhi concurrent with intelligence
that immediately follows the supreme attribute. The path of seeing is said to mark the point
at which one becomes an Arya, or a noble one." [TODO: Who is the quote attributed to? Patrul Rinpoche? From where?]

According to Patrul Rinpoche, "It is called the path of seeing because it is here that one first
sees the supermundane wisdom of the noble ones." It is the entrance to the first bhumi, known
as Perfect Joy. (It is said in the pith instructions that the path of accumulation is the stage
of understanding, the path of joining is the stage of experience, and the path of seeing
is the stage of realization.)

In phase 1 we are introduced to the fruit (11th bhumi) as the path.

  Shantideva said, "Unless you know the secret key point, whatever you do will miss the mark."
  The secret key point of mind is that its nature is a self-existing, original wakefulness.
  To identify the key point we need to receive the pointing-out instruction.

  The essential point of the Great Perfection is this clear, naked awareness---our mind,
  right now, unaltered, relaxed, and without even the slightest change. And that's it.

  Mind is the root of all samsara and nirvana.\
  Once it is realized, there is nothing to cultivate, so rest at ease.

  The three phases of things arising, abiding, and being freed do not take place
  anywhere other than within the immediacy of awareness, so the expression
  "their own place" refers to bare awareness abiding as naked original purity
  within the natural basic space of dharmakaya. The expression "holding to their own place"
  refers to recognition of this.

  So, in this present case the view is where you are introduced directly to rigpa,
  and you practice by maintaining that recognition. If you have already gained direct
  introduction to rigpa, you do not necessarily have to go through the preliminary
  of examining the arising, remaining, and ceasing of thoughts to reveal
  "the mind's hidden flaw," and so arrive at a decisive conclusion about it.
  In the Madhyamaka approach of the sutra tradition, however, all of these steps are necessary.
