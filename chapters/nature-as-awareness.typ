// The first Key Point of the Recognition chapter: the nature of mind is Awareness.
#import "../template.typ": *

If pointing out to awareness "as the nature of mind" is successful then there will be an "Ah-ha!" moment,
even if it's very subtle. Like noticing something that has always been there, we can discern an acknowledgement.
The recognition could also settle in like an emotional "Ah-ha!", but it's undeniable when one
has recognized naked awareness.

There are many indicators we may use for evidence to verify recognition.
Beings typically, immediately, apprehend this recognition, and without guidance could delay
their familiarization for a significant time. "Apprehend" means we're not leaving it alone
as naked awareness but we form concepts, tell stories about awareness, lay claim to awareness
as typical patterned tendencies get mingled in.
This is why we have a second phase, which is to familiarize with the recognition.

If pointing out to bindus (light spheres within light rays) as the "nature of reality" is successful,
the practitioner will see tiny light spheres inside light rays which appear to have rainbow halos.
This further leads into pure vision.

The key point here as the trekcho aspect is that the practitioner is pointed to
awareness as the nature of mind, permeating all experiences.

The togal aspect
involves introduction to clear light but also to light rays, bindus, and vajra chains,
which are mind-light phenomena seen by conditioned mind, thereby bridging
the conditioned mind with pure luminous mind.
Then conditioned mind is essentially turning in on itself, like water pouring into water,
as mind recognizing mind.

This phase corresponds with the 3rd of the 5 paths as stated by Patrul Rinpoche:

  The path of seeing is so called because it is the stage at which we first see
  the supermundane wisdom of the noble ones.
]

This phase corresponds with the 3rd of the 5 paths: "The path of seeing is the direct
perception of the truth of reality through nonconceptual samadhi concurrent with intelligence
that immediately follows the supreme attribute. The path of seeing is said to mark the point
at which one becomes an Arya, or a noble one." #todo([TODO: this is a quotation from Mipham's "The Entrance to the Way of the Wise" aka "Introduction to Scholarship", hunt down that text.])

In phase 1 we are introduced to the fruit (11th bhumi) as the path.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche @as-it-is-2])[
  Shantideva said, "Unless you know the secret key point, whatever you do will miss the mark."
  The secret key point of mind is that its nature is a self-existing, original wakefulness.
  To identify the key point we need to receive the pointing-out instruction.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Jigme Lingpa @lotsawa-directly-seeing])[
  The essential point of the Great Perfection is this clear, naked awareness---our mind,
  right now, unaltered, relaxed, and without even the slightest change. And that's it.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Saraha @lotsawa-concise-mahamudra-preliminaries])[
  Mind is the root of all samsara and nirvana.\
  Once it is realized, there is nothing to cultivate, so rest at ease.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @treasure-trove])[ // p.247
  The three phases of things arising, abiding, and being freed do not take place
  anywhere other than within the immediacy of awareness, so the expression
  "their own place" refers to bare awareness abiding as naked original purity
  within the natural basic space of dharmakaya. The expression "holding to their own place"
  refers to recognition of this.

  So, in this present case the view is where you are introduced directly to rigpa,
  and you practice by maintaining that recognition. If you have already gained direct
  introduction to rigpa, you do not necessarily have to go through the preliminary
  of examining the arising, remaining, and ceasing of thoughts to reveal
  "the mind's hidden flaw," and so arrive at a decisive conclusion about it.
  In the Madhyamaka approach of the sutra tradition, however, all of these steps are necessary.
