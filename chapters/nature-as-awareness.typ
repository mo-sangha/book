// The first Key Point of the Recognition chapter: the nature of mind is Awareness.
#import "../template.typ": *

The key point here is that the practitioner is pointed to awareness as the nature of mind; the very nature of
the 80 cognitive states, which include aversion (33), attachment (40) and ignorance (7)--things like sadness, states of peace, fear, sesations, etc. are all permeated by awarensss. The four foundations of mindfulness are permeated by awarensss--emotions, mental formations, the body and environment. So one is introduced to an alternative, a silver lining which is pure present within all of reality. These states of consciousness can be compared to ice drifting on the waters of awareness, being more dense, they are none other than awareness (cognition, rigpa, vidya, etc.). Here are several ways one is introduced to the nature of mind.


(here we list as many legitimate pointing out methods as possible)

The most direct method is a silent mind to mind abiding from an authentic awareness holder.

Here are some others...

Looking into the nature of thought
looking at the watcher (watching the watcher)
Looking at the one who is sad, happy, mad, etc.
Being aware of awareness
The top and bottom of breath
The space between thoughts
The space which holds stillness and movement (mahamudra)
PHET (clearing the mind of thought activity, even if just for a moment)
thinking of as many thoughts as possible and resting in awareness as that occurs


The implications of this pointing out is that you now have a foundation for self-liberation. You have broken free of karmic practices
and the conceptual mind, taking awareness as the path.

(Here I'd like to make citations like Garab Dorje's statements and things emphasizing self-liberation)

Embracing the larger scope

In our approach, this means building trust in awareness as the path, adjusting to effortlessness and familiarizing with your whole mind, the heart essence. Here we begin allowing natural wisdom and compassion to blossom while releasing karmic conditioning, allowing it to liberate in its own place without interference.

Coming to the decisive experience means trust is unfolding from direct seeing of freedom (insight); which includes the 4 dzogchen samayas-Mind revealing itself (1) beyond words and characterization. Mind is revealed as (2) spacious, (3) purely present and (4) free of division.
One has enough evidence within 1-3 months of pointing out to release the conceptual dependence, have a sense of surrender, and begin trusting the ineffability of mind. One begins seeing contractions into thoughts, emotions, moods, etc. so naturally favors spaciousness. There is realization of temporal contractions into past, present and future so the 4th time strengthens as awareness purely present. The last samaya is oneness beyond division which begins actualization when the environment and spheres of conception, permeated by awareness, begin softening and thawing out, course consciousness defusing, the reification of the 5 lights begins releasing naturally as luminous clarity free of reference point. The next phase is dzogchen samatha, stability into awareness, which will always be coupled with insight.
