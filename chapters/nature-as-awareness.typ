// The first Key Point of the Recognition chapter: the nature of mind is Awareness.
#import "../template.typ": *

The nature of mind is the nature of all experiences and appearances.

The key point here is that the practitioner is pointed to awareness as the nature of mind:
the very nature of the 80 cognitive states, which include aversion (33), attachment (40)
and ignorance (7)---things like sadness, states of peace, fear, sensations
are all permeated by awareness.
But also, for the practitioner, the four foundations of mindfulness are permeated by awareness---emotions,
mental formations, the body and environment.

NEEDED! Citation: Why it's important to be pointed out, that it's the prerequisite for practice.
