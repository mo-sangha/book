// The first Key Point of the Recognition chapter: the nature of mind is Awareness.
#import "../template.typ": *

The key point here is that the practitioner is pointed to awareness as the nature of mind;
the very nature of the 80 cognitive states, which include aversion (33), attachment (40)
and ignorance (7)---things like sadness, states of peace, fear, sensations, etc.
are all permeated by awareness.

The four foundations of mindfulness are permeated by awareness---emotions,
mental formations, the body and environment.
So one is introduced to an alternative, a silver lining which is pure present within all of reality.
These states of consciousness can be compared to ice drifting on the waters of awareness,
being more contracted, they are none other than awareness (cognition, rigpa, vidya, etc.).

In the next section are several ways one is introduced to the nature of mind.
