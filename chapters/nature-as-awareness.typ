// The first Key Point of the Recognition chapter: the nature of mind is Awareness.
#import "../template.typ": *

The nature of mind is the nature of all experiences and appearances.

The key point here is that the practitioner is pointed to awareness as the nature of mind:
the very nature of the 80 cognitive states, which include aversion (33), attachment (40)
and ignorance (7)---things like sadness, states of peace, fear, sensations
are all permeated by awareness.
But also, for the practitioner, the four foundations of mindfulness are permeated by awareness---emotions,
mental formations, the body and environment.

  Shantideva said, "Unless you know the secret key point, whatever you do will miss the mark."
  The secret key point of mind is that its nature is a self-existing, original wakefulness.
  To identify the key point we need to receive the pointing-out instruction.
