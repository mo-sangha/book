Confidence in self-liberation begins to come to fruition,
embracing ineffability and revelation.

Once familiarized, the practitioner embraces effortlessness to a significant degree.
They are becoming free of inclinations towards antidotes and philosophical views or
searching for spiritual and mystical remedies.
While complementary practices may still be used, self-liberation is primary.

  Your recognition of awareness is challenged when you perceive objects manifesting
  to your five senses or when denial or affirmation, ingrained fixations, or strong
  afflictive emotions occur in your mind.

  These can be eliminated by distilling the limpid lucidity of awareness
  and eliciting its unobstructed essence in all its nakedness.

  When appearances manifest, when thoughts arise, or at any other time,
  you recognize bare awareness in all its nakedness, and so you need not rely
  on any other factor whatsoever. In that context, the bare state of awareness
  in all its nakedness (which cuts through mental ties to the three times)
  is spontaneously present as a supreme state of equalness that is utterly lucid,
  for it arises naturally as the enlightened intent of naturally settled dharmakaya.
  No matter what arises in this state, do not reflect back on what has passed,
  do not think ahead about what is yet to come, and do not analyze the present moment
  in between. Rather, ensure that you do not stray from the recognition of bare
  awareness in all its nakedness.

  When something such as an afflictive emotion arises vividly, in letting it arise
  you recognize awareness, elicited in all its nakedness. As you rest without
  contrivance and do not stray from that recognition, thus cutting through the
  continuity of the three times, enlightened intent arises naturally
  as meditative stability that does not stray from the true nature of phenomena.
