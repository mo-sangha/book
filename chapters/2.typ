It's most important to remember the recognition you had before.
If the recognition was vivid enough, then the practitioner can hinge on the recognition,
taking the fruit as the path, enough to integrate all experiences.

Preliminary dispositions will affect the strength of recognition.
If someone has done years of meditation, ngondro practices, or even has had life
changing experiences, it could determine the depth of recognition and familiarization.
Here the practitioner is not advised to add more practices, vows, or anything else, but
to simply add awareness to your current disposition. Within a month of short sessions
repeated often, there will be stability (Dzogchen samatha).
Ultimately, there are no requirements for integrating awareness into one's life.
We want our current conditioning (karma) to breathe out rather than creating
new conditioning.
This doesn't imply that we become a zombie.
In the face of self-liberation we still have amazement, magical expression and mystery,
safety, wisdom, naturalness, and sheer inexpressibility.

  // "Oh, in that case," you might think, "there's no need for meditation."
  // Well, I can assure you that there is a need!
  // The mere recognition of awareness will not liberate you.
  // Throughout your lives from beginningless time, you have been enveloped
  // in false beliefs and deluded habits. From then until now you have spent every
  // moment as a miserable, pathetic slave of your thoughts! And when you die,
  // it's not at all certain where you will go. You will follow your karma,
  // and you will have to suffer.

  This is the reason why you must meditate, continuously preserving the state
  of awareness you have been introduced to.
  The omniscient Longchenpa has said,
  "You may recognize your own nature, but if you do not meditate and get used to it,
  you will be like a baby left on a battlefield: you'll be carried off by the enemy,
  the hostile army of your own thoughts!"

  In general terms, meditation means _becoming familiar_ with the state of resting
  in the primordial uncontrived nature, through being spontaneously,
  naturally, constantly mindful.
  It means getting used to leaving the state of awareness alone, divested
  of all distraction and clinging.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== #todo([Key Point])
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The key point is integration of the four foundations of mindfulness, internal and external reality, into recognition
via effortless abiding, gaining confidence in self-liberation. What appears to be liberating?
The 8 aspects of consciousness, 5 afflictions, 5 elements, 3 poisons, self, and other.

There are several provisional methods we can use to familiarize with the view,
but effortless abiding is the key point of self-liberation.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_The Two Segments (Hevajra Tantra)_ @lotsawa-casket])[
  Thus, not meditating with the conceptual mind\
  is how everyone should meditate.
]

One can use the method of looking into the nature of a thought, including emotions and states of consciousness.
When we're having invasive thoughts, for example, we can turn awareness to the thinking and the thought
will typically vanish, leaving naked cognizance.
This is the same as seeing the space in which a thought comes, abides, and ceases.
Awareness holds a vast spectrum of activity, from thought movement to emotional upheaval.

One of the first "barriers" is the course linguistic mind with its electro-magnetic psychic constraint.
When we're in thought proliferation it binds us to a smaller dimension of cognition.
Here, linguistic mind is defined as the inner narrator, storytelling,
imaginations, and ruminations of various types, corresponding with the 6th aspect of
the 8 aspects of consciousness.
This could have a somatic location in the brain, indicating itself with a feeling of
noticeable contraction in the soft tissue of the brain and along the neck.
Facial indications can also be visible during the psychic contraction
of course linguistic proliferation.

// TODO: The quote here is quoting another work.
#quote(block: true, attribution: [Patrul Rinpoche @dalai-lama-dzogchen])[ // p.71
  So, whether the mind is still, active, or whatever, it is not a question of overcoming
  each individual negative emotion and thought with its own separate remedy.
  Instead, the sole remedy for whatever thought or emotion may occur, the one remedy for all,
  is the recognition of that view which was introduced previously, and that alone.
  So: "Recognize that dharmakaya you recognized before."
]

When the mind is busy on these coarse levels, there's no need to try to stop thoughts or analyze content.
Familiarizing with effortless abiding, the course thoughts will subside and more subtle aspects of mind
will become exposed within volumetric ever-present awareness.
At this point, awareness can be nascent, seemingly in the background.
These coarse narratives have heavier, more noticeable weight, so alleviation is somewhat easy to discern.
We can feel it when thinking slows down, but also our investment into the thinking can be noticed.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche @as-it-is-2])[ // p.84
  // To get carried away by a thought is the state of a sentient being.
  // Rather than that, recognize your basic state as being the essence, nature, and capacity
  // that are the three kayas of the buddhas.
  Remain in uncontrived naturalness for short moments, repeated many times.
  You _can_ become accustomed to this.
  The short moment _can_ grow longer.
  // In one instant of remaining in unfabricated naturalness, a kalpa of negative karma is purified.
]

Emotions (also corresponding with the 6th aspect) are another kind of thought that the mind is having,
but with more body weight than coarse surface thinking.
In this approach, there's nothing to do with emotions either: they are left in awareness
during short sessions and also during the normal day/night.
They can be left as pure energy in awareness as labeling and analysis subside.
When, through effortlessness, emotions become lighter and coarse thinking has ceased fusing the mind,
there are more aspects of experience being exposed.
Particularly the subjective sense of "the one who is thinking," which is like an emotion yet even more subtle.
This is what's considered the 7th egoic consciousness, or conditioned self, the watcher, the witness,
and many other names.

// TODO: The quote here is quoting another work.
#quote(block: true, attribution: [Patrul Rinpoche @dalai-lama-dzogchen])[ // p.73
  In this way, always remind yourself of the view, which is the clear light
  recognized in you as your true nature, and rest in that state. Apart from that,
  the crucial point is neither to suppress nor indulge, neither accept nor reject,
  in any way, the thoughts or emotions which are the energy of rigpa:
  "Rest in the aspect of awareness, beyond all description."
]

Within awareness are the 3 spheres of conceptual consciousness: subject, action, and object, which
correspond with the five senses.
For example, eyes-seeing-birds, ears-hearing-bells.
The thinking/feeling is based on these interactions, and a sense of self apprehends the thinking/feeling:
for example, "I like seeing birds."
If the mind highly favors a particular visual sight, there will be more psychic weight than if no grasping
were involved, so this weight is naturally discernible within effortlessness.
Aversion as an inversion will also be discernible within non-referential empty cognizance.
Within awareness we can notice ourselves holding visual objects, sounds, tastes, thoughts, emotions, etc.,
but also the one who's seeing, hearing, tasting, etc. becomes exposed as the taproot of duality and confusion.
When all three spheres are left be, then all four foundations of mindfulness are naturally within
space-like awareness, being allowed to settle in their own place and revealing ineffable
ultimate truth transcending concepts.

  // of enlightenment, the very essence of the nine progressive approaches.

The implications are that we are becoming familiar with the view and effortless abiding,
which facilitates self-liberation.

Things are starting to liberate in their own place, and this serves as evidence
for self-liberation, unveiling confidence in the practitioner.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @way-of-abiding])[
  Deliberate action misleads---look at the confusing appearances of samsara.\
  Effort corrupts---think about the machinations of suffering.\
  With virtue and harm, there is an uninterrupted flow of happiness and suffering.\
  Karma is reinforced, causing one to wander high and low through samsara.\
  There is no opportunity to escape the ocean of conditioned existence.
]

Conditioned mind can resolve itself.
Doing nothing about our experiences isn't easy at first: many people will slowly step into
effortlessness through validation.
Within a month of consistent practice, one can verify that, when left alone, there is natural
resolution to affliction and confusion.
The plasticity of karmic conditioning can exhaust itself within awareness.
Referencing the 3 modes of liberation, we know when we're seeing an old habit, greeting them
like an old friend.
We may even be stuck in a mood we've had many times, like another old friend.
Invasive thoughts, bodily aches, and stories can all be considered like that from the point of view of awareness.
When we're in a mood, holding a perspective, feeling the somatic contractions, this can be relieved
by just letting be within awareness, so it's like a snake uncoiling itself, the 2nd mode of liberation.
The conditioned self can be like this as well.
The 3rd mode of liberation is when thoughts flow naturally as expressions of timeless awareness
without our grasping, fabricating, and elaboration: like a thief entering an empty house,
nothing is lost and evenness prevails.
No matter how relief is appearing, spaciousness, increased visibility, and other indicators like
clear light, dream yoga, natural compassion, and bliss will all solve as evidence for this
self-harmonization of consciousness/mind.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @treasure-trove])[ // p.275
  Understand that ordinary confused mind---which is rooted in the nonrecognition of awareness,
  reifies sense objects as having identity, and is unable to "stay in one place" without being
  caught up in sense objects---is a confined space. And so forge the path with unobstructed,
  nonconceptual timeless awareness, free of ordinary consciousness that engages in thinking
  in terms of identity.
]

This then corresponds with the second part of Garab Dorje's 3 statements:
the practitioner is gaining confidence in self-liberation to the point of complete release.
Emptiness/insubstantiality is beginning to naturally blossom as the revelation of luminous oneness:
wisdom and compassion effortlessly revealed non-dualistically.
Embracing all beings and the world as a teacher, until it's not.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_Naturally Arising Awareness_ @treasure-trove])[ // p.117

  there is no view, meditation, or conduct.\

  How could there be anything to do or any doing?

As coarse and conditioned mind clears up, the lucid aspect of mind begins showing.
This can be strengthened by dream experiences/insights as well as togal light practices.
Enlightened mind will begin to expose itself within non-referential space, in inexpressible ways.
Normalizing the extraordinary is recommended as the practitioner allows the view to saturate
conditioned reality.

The practitioner adopts effortlessness as the primary remedy.
Mental and emotional conditioning is allowed to self-liberate within its own place.
This includes the conditioned self, which is the primary anchor for cyclic existence.

Discerning self-liberation enhances natural confidence, leading into pure effortless abiding,
to include all four postures, day, and night.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Khenpo Gangshar @lotsawa-naturally-liberating])[
  Learn to make this distinction between awareness and mind or thought;
  rely on the stability of the former and purify the latter.

  The essence of the techniques of taking illness, destructive emotion, the intermediate
  state, and confusion to enhance the path is simply to rest in the natural state.
]

Awareness is now naturally discerning conditioned consciousness (sem, marigpa, avidya)
from spacious clear wisdom mind (semnyi, rigpa, vidya), self-resolving.
Spontaneous presence as empty lucidity or empty cognition begins unveiling ultimate truth,
mind free from division (bodhicitta).
At first, mind is not empty of subject/object, which are conditioned patterns with momentum.
When these patterns exhaust, there is freedom in oneness.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, _Finding Rest in the Nature of the Mind_ @trilogy-of-rest-vol-1])[
  When I watch the thoughts as they arise,\
  The watcher vanishes.\
  I search for it but nowhere is it found.\
  Neither is the searcher seen---\
  There is just a freedom from conceptual elaboration.\
  There's no agent; there's no object of its action.
]

The watcher, or conditioned self, is also known as the 7th aspect of consciousness.
This is a "thought" in the sense of being a programmed tendency for apprehension.
For example: "I like ice cream," "My name is John," "My favorite color is red."
When this reference point is left alone within awareness, there can be equality and evenness
of the mind, now abiding as awareness in a kind of psychic inversion.
This is sometimes compared to water being poured into water, or like the space
inside a vase meeting the space outside the vase when it cracks.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Pema Karpo @lotsawa-casket])[
  When settling naturally and without contrivance, realization dawns.
  When maintaining that state, like the flow of a river, it dawns in full.

  and constantly settle in equanimity, O yogi!
]

True effortlessness can be approached responsibly.
When we begin seeing our emotions within awareness, they become nourished and finally cared for.
It's not easy to leave a thought-pattern, habitual tendency, or heavy emotion alone to bathe
within pure present knowingness, but as we adjust, as we reorientate into a larger scope of mind,
these things become like ocean waves arising and naturally subsiding while awareness remains
firm like a mountain.
As we go about day and night, all actions, all realizations, can be left alone to flourish without conditioning.

Confidence in self-liberation begins to come to fruition,
embracing ineffability and revelation.

Once familiarized, the practitioner embraces effortlessness to a significant degree.
They are becoming free of inclinations towards antidotes and philosophical views or
searching for spiritual and mystical remedies.
While complementary practices may still be used, self-liberation is primary.
