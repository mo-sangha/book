  "Oh, in that case," you might think, "there's no need for meditation."
  Well, I can assure you that there is a need!
  The mere recognition of awareness will not liberate you.
  Throughout your lives from beginningless time, you have been enveloped
  in false beliefs and deluded habits. From then until now you have spent every
  moment as a miserable, pathetic slave of your thoughts! And when you die,
  it's not at all certain where you will go. You will follow your karma,
  and you will have to suffer.

  This is the reason why you must meditate, continuously preserving the state
  of awareness you have been introduced to.
  The omniscient Longchenpa has said,
  "You may recognize your own nature, but if you do not meditate and get used to it,
  you will be like a baby left on a battlefield: you'll be carried off by the enemy,
  the hostile army of your own thoughts!"

  In general terms, meditation means _becoming familiar_ with the state of resting
  in the primordial uncontrived nature, through being spontaneously,
  naturally, constantly mindful.
  It means getting used to leaving the state of awareness alone, divested
  of all distraction and clinging.

The key point is integrating the four foundations of mindfulness into recognition
via effortless abiding, gaining confidence in self-liberation. What appears to be liberating?
The 8 aspects of consciousness, 5 afflictions, 5 elements, 3 poisons, self, and other.

The key point of the second phase is familiarization with the nature of mind and effortless abiding.

There are several provisional methods we can use to familiarize with the view,
but effortless abiding is the key point of self-liberation.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche @as-it-is-2])[ // p.84
  To get carried away by a thought is the state of a sentient being.
  Rather than that, recognize your basic state as being the essence, nature, and capacity
  that are the three kayas of the buddhas.
  Remain in uncontrived naturalness for short moments, repeated many times.
  You _can_ become accustomed to this.
  The short moment _can_ grow longer.
  In one instant of remaining in unfabricated naturalness, a kalpa of negative karma is purified.

  So, whether the mind is still, active, or whatever, it is not a question of overcoming
  each individual negative emotion and thought with its own separate remedy.
  Instead, the sole remedy for whatever thought or emotion may occur, the one remedy for all,
  is the recognition of that view which was introduced previously, and that alone.
  So: "Recognize that dharmakaya you recognized before."

  In this way, always remind yourself of the view, which is the clear light
  recognized in you as your true nature, and rest in that state. Apart from that,
  the crucial point is neither to suppress nor indulge, neither accept nor reject,
  in any way, the thoughts or emotions which are the energy of rigpa:
  "Rest in the aspect of awareness, beyond all description."

The implications are that we are becoming familiar with the view and effortless abiding,
which facilitates self-liberation.

Things are starting to liberate in its own place, and this serves as evidence
for self-liberation, building confidence in the practitioner.

Self-liberation is the key to liberation itself.

The practitioner adopts effortlessness as the primary remedy.
Within effortlessness, mental and emotional conditioning is allowed
to self-liberate within its own place.
This includes the conditioned self, which is the primary factor in cyclic existence.

Discerning self-liberation enhances natural confidence, leading into pure effortless abiding,
to include all four postures, day, and night.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Khenpo Gangshar @lotsawa-naturally-liberating])[
  Learn to make this distinction between awareness and mind or thought;
  rely on the stability of the former and purify the latter.

  The essence of the techniques of taking illness, destructive emotion, the intermediate
  state, and confusion to enhance the path is simply to rest in the natural state.

Confidence in self-liberation begins to come to fruition,
embracing ineffability and revelation.

Once familiarized, the practitioner embraces effortlessness to a significant degree.
They are becoming free of inclinations towards antidotes and philosophical views or
searching for spiritual and mystical remedies.
While complementary practices may still be used, self-liberation is primary.

  Your recognition of awareness is challenged when you perceive objects manifesting
  to your five senses or when denial or affirmation, ingrained fixations, or strong
  afflictive emotions occur in your mind.

  These can be eliminated by distilling the limpid lucidity of awareness

  When appearances manifest, when thoughts arise, or at any other time,
  you recognize bare awareness in all its nakedness, and so you need not rely
  on any other factor whatsoever. In that context, the bare state of awareness
  in all its nakedness (which cuts through mental ties to the three times)
  is spontaneously present as a supreme state of equalness that is utterly lucid,
  for it arises naturally as the enlightened intent of naturally settled dharmakaya.
  No matter what arises in this state, do not reflect back on what has passed,
  do not think ahead about what is yet to come, and do not analyze the present moment
  in between. Rather, ensure that you do not stray from the recognition of bare
  awareness in all its nakedness.

  When something such as an afflictive emotion arises vividly, in letting it arise

  as meditative stability that does not stray from the true nature of phenomena.
