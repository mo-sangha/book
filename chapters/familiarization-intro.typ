One has enough evidence within 1-3 months of pointing out to release the conceptual dependence,
have a sense of surrender, and begin trusting the ineffability of mind.
One begins seeing contractions into thoughts, emotions, moods, etc. so naturally favors spaciousness.
There is realization of temporal contractions into past, present and future so the 4th time
strengthens as awareness purely present. The last samaya is oneness beyond division which begins
actualization when the environment and spheres of conception, permeated by awareness,
begin softening and thawing out, course consciousness defusing, the reification of the 5 lights
begins releasing naturally as luminous clarity free of reference point.

The next phase is dzogchen samatha, stability into awareness, which will always be coupled with insight.
