// Familiarization: the Key Point (intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

The key point of the second phase is familiarization with the nature of mind and effortless abiding.

There are several provisional methods we can use to familiarize with the view,
but effortless abiding is the key point of self-liberation.

  If, through the key point of effortlessness, there is familiarity
  with the very essence of enlightenment---the spontaneous presence of phenomena---although
  buddhahood is timeless, there is awakening to buddhahood anew.
  This is the unsurpassable pinnacle of the vajra heart essence---the vast expanse
  of enlightenment, the very essence of the nine progressive approaches.
