// Familiarization: the Key Point (intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

The key point is integrating the four foundations of mindfulness into recognition
via effortless abiding, gaining confidence in self-liberation. What appears to be liberating?
The 8 aspects of consciousness, 5 afflictions, 5 elements, 3 poisons, self, and other.

The key point of the second phase is familiarization with the nature of mind and effortless abiding.

There are several provisional methods we can use to familiarize with the view,
but effortless abiding is the key point of self-liberation.

  In one instant of remaining in unfabricated naturalness, a kalpa of negative karma is purified.
  Remain in uncontrived naturalness for short moments, repeated many times.
  You _can_ become accustomed to this.
  The short moment _can_ grow longer.
  To get carried away by a thought is the state of a sentient being.
  Rather than that, recognize your basic state as being the essence, nature, and capacity
  that are the three kayas of the buddhas.

  If, through the key point of effortlessness, there is familiarity
  with the very essence of enlightenment---the spontaneous presence of phenomena---although
  buddhahood is timeless, there is awakening to buddhahood anew.
  This is the unsurpassable pinnacle of the vajra heart essence---the vast expanse
  of enlightenment, the very essence of the nine progressive approaches.

  Thus, not meditating with the conceptual mind\
  is how everyone should meditate.

  So, whether the mind is still, active, or whatever, it is not a question of overcoming
  each individual negative emotion and thought with its own separate remedy.
  Instead, the sole remedy for whatever thought or emotion may occur, the one remedy for all,
  is the recognition of that view which was introduced previously, and that alone.
  So: "Recognize that dharmakaya you recognized before."

  In this way, always remind yourself of the view, which is the clear light
  recognized in you as your true nature, and rest in that state. Apart from that,
  the crucial point is neither to suppress nor indulge, neither accept nor reject,
  in any way, the thoughts or emotions which are the energy of rigpa:
  "Rest in the aspect of awareness, beyond all description."
