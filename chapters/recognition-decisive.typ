  With respect to the very essence of timeless awareness, free of elaboration,
  as things arise due to its dynamic energy it is possible to identify awareness
  in all its pristine nakedness, without the reifying effect of concepts---without
  investigating anything outwardly, examining anything inwardly, or deliberately settling
  in between these alternatives. This awareness is realized to be nothing other than
  that very essence, free of elaboration, experienced in all its nakedness.
  Thus, it is nondual, naturally occurring timeless awareness.

  Yet by being mindful, not with a tight, deliberate mindfulness but simply
  not forgetting to keep recognizing your own nature, eventually at some point the
  ultimate truth beyond conceptual elaboration will dawn, transcending all
  analogies or definitions.
