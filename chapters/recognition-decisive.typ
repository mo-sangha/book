// Recognition: Coming to the Decisive Conclusion (section intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

You have recognized the nature of mind and are ready to move to phase 2.

You are comfortable enough in your recognition to begin familiarizing with the nature
of mind, departing from conditioned reality.
Since recognition has occurred, now cognitive diffusion, or the unbinding of mind, can take place.

  With respect to the very essence of timeless awareness, free of elaboration,
  as things arise due to its dynamic energy it is possible to identify awareness
  in all its pristine nakedness, without the reifying effect of concepts---without
  investigating anything outwardly, examining anything inwardly, or deliberately settling
  in between these alternatives. This awareness is realized to be nothing other than
  that very essence, free of elaboration, experienced in all its nakedness.
  Thus, it is nondual, naturally occurring timeless awareness.
