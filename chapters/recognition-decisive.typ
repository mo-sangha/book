// Recognition: Coming to the Decisive Experience (section intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

Coming to the decisive experience means trust is unfolding from direct seeing of freedom (insight);
which includes the 4 dzogchen samayas-Mind revealing itself (1) beyond words and characterization.
Mind is revealed as (2) spacious, (3) purely present and (4) free of division.

One has enough evidence within 1-3 months of pointing out to release the conceptual dependence,
have a sense of surrender, and begin trusting the ineffability of mind.
One begins seeing contractions into thoughts, emotions, moods, etc. so naturally favors spaciousness.
There is realization of temporal contractions into past, present and future so the 4th time
strengthens as awareness purely present. The last samaya is oneness beyond division which begins
actualization when the environment and spheres of conception, permeated by awareness,
begin softening and thawing out, course consciousness defusing, the reification of the 5 lights
begins releasing naturally as luminous clarity free of reference point.

The next phase is dzogchen samatha, stability into awareness, which will always be coupled with insight.
