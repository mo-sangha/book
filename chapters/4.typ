= Complete Liberation


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Key Point
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Enlightenment in its full fruition.
The taproot of conditioned existence, which is the conditioned self, has been uprooted.
Appearances involving identity are liberated as luminosity unconfined by reification.
The ignorance/confusion that initiates cyclic existence and the twelve links
of dependent origination has been totally exhausted.
One's mind is no longer fabricating mind-luminosity into the reifications of the elements.
One is embraced within tathagatagarbha, the womb and absolute basis, which
completely exposes itself as a pure consciousness dimension (pure land).
This is traditionally known as the heart essence because non-referential compassion
naturally unveils itself. Wisdom and compassion have come to their full fruition.

The first vision is realized as true emptiness/freedom from the conditioned self (eleventh bhumi)
and is synonymous with samyaksaṃbuddha, full enlightenment. More specifically, this phase describes complete
freedom of the seventh egoic consciousness (mānas-vijñāna)/the conditioned pattern of apprehending
and dividing.

  When realizing by way of freedom from thoughts\
  This is conventionally labeled "seeing emptiness".\
  "Not seeing---that is seeing indeed"\
  So say the extremely profound sutras.\
  Here, there is no seeing and no one that sees.\
  There's no beginning or end. It is peace.\
  Entities and non-entities are relinquished,\
  It is thought-free, without focus.\
  There is no abiding and no abode,\
  Neither coming nor going, and without analogy.\
  Inexpressible and imperceptible,\
  It is unchanging, unconditioned.\
  When practitioners realize this,\
  They eradicate afflictive and cognitive obscurations.

== Discerning the Implications
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The five wisdoms are now in full fruition, which includes the non-referential wisdom of equality,
discernment, all-accomplishing, mirror-like, and dharmadhatu as a counterpart to the five
poisons, five elements, and the reifications of conditioned mind in ten directions.

Time and space have lost their identity as pure presence, infinitely open,
is allowed to flourish as all-encompassing (fruition of the four Dzogchen samayas).
Wisdom, or super-cognition, shines in a volumetric way which ensures the first wisdom of equality,
meaning awareness is omni-present in and as people, as objects both animate and inanimate.
Wisdom of discernment without effort is ensured even in the appearance of conventional effort
like eating food. A harmony and co-emergent flow is ensured as all-accomplishing wisdom in
action, speech, and mind.
Within the non-dual mind, mirror-like expressions are limitless while never departing from
awakened cognition, a supreme basis.
All phenomena are seen as empty appearances without a seer, within non-referential knowingness:
this is the wisdom of dharmadhatu.
Like a dreamer who can see themselves acting in a dream and interacting with dream objects,
the entire appearance is within the scope of one cognition, a single sphere of pure consciousness.

The lucid, intuitive mind is no longer nascent.
Wholeness of mind is now in the forefront, fully actualized as the basis for
dynamic expressions: thoughts, speech, and action.
Pure view encompasses karmic view, so one can understand both naturally.
What was once distorted (dukkha) is now in harmony (sukha).

  Here there is no separation at all between the object of awareness and the knower who is aware;
  they are inseparable. Moreover, the observing awareness (_rig pa_) has no identifiable essence whatsoever.
  And that is why this is classified as the unity of awareness and emptiness.
]

Impossible to fathom with concepts, there is cognition without apprehension.
The eggshells of conceptual mind and identity have fallen away, leaving an unknowable
sky-like presence beyond existential notions of singularity or multiplicity.
Thoughts can no longer captivate the mind, leading it astray.
Like sparks of the fire cannot hurt the sky, thoughts are simply expressions of mind,
co-emergent ornaments leaving no trace, like writing on water.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama @dalai-lama-dzogchen])[ // p.186
  The true, and best, mode of liberation is where thoughts are liberated without benefit or harm,
  and this is compared to a thief breaking into an empty house. There is nothing for the thief
  to steal, nothing for an empty house to lose. Even though thought arises, it does so within
  the expanse of rigpa, and owing to the energy of rigpa. When it ceases, it ceases in and of itself.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Embracing the Larger Scope
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Here there is a divine union so familiar that it's like being in the presence of a loving parent.
The heart is infinite in seeing, empathy is beyond comprehension.
There is complete freedom to feel, there is pliancy to live as beingness.
Cyclic existence has ended.
Internal, external, day, and night are pure liberation.
There is complete freedom from the cycle of re-becoming, which includes birth,
sickness, injury, and death.
One is no longer bound to conditioned existence, traditionally called samsara (cyclic existence).
Due to the heart essence, benefit for beings still ensnared within illusory existence is ensured.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @treasure-trove])[ // p.116
  Yogins who have realized the ultimate meaning of this great perfection in all its nakedness
  experience awareness, pure and simple, in all its nakedness. And so, while sense objects
  manifest in light of awareness, that awareness is not lost outwardly in response to those objects.
  Thus, dualistic perception, the root of samsara, is rendered null and void.
  As an indication that awareness, pure and simple, pristine in all its nakedness,
  is not lost in response to sense objects, there are no attachments to or fixations
  on sensory appearances, or attempts to suppress or indulge in them.
  Since samsara is as free as nirvana, we refer to "dharmakaya arising unobstructedly."

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Coming to the Decisive Conclusion
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The decisive conclusion is complete freedom.
The mind is no longer bound by cognitive and emotional obscurations or sense appearances.
The very last cognitive obscurations have exhausted, including the apprehension of emptiness.
Within a full release into ineffability, without grasping views, and free from fixation and desire,
awareness has exposed even the most subtle cognitive apprehension.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Āryadeva's _Four Hundred Verses on the Middle Way_ @dalai-lama-dzogchen])[ // p.187
  The awareness that is the seed of existence,\
  Has objects as its sphere of activity,\
  When selflessness is seen in objects,\
  The seed of existence is destroyed.
]

At this point the practitioner is free from cyclic conditioned existence.
Conventionally speaking, a pure expression of mind is ensured in a mandala of radiance.
Super-cognition, with multi-dimensionality, can freely shine, while the infinite is readily available
in terms of creativity.

This is the place we have always been, home.
