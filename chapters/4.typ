Enlightenment in its full fruition.

The taproot of conditioned existence, which is the conditioned self, has been uprooted.
The ignorance/confusion that initiates cyclic existence has been exhausted.
One's mind is no longer fabricating wisdom-luminosity into the reifications of the elements.
One is embraced within the tathagatagarbha, the womb and the very basis, which becomes
so familiar that it is just as safe as we once thought our sense indulgences were.

This is traditionally known as the heart essence because non-referential compassion
naturally unveils itself. Wisdom and compassion have come to their full fruition.

The first vision is realized as true emptiness/freedom from the conditioned self (11th bhumi)
and is synonymous with samyaksaṃbuddha. More specifically, this phase describes complete
freedom of the 7th egoic consciousness (mānas-vijñāna)/the conditioned pattern of apprehending
acts of consciousness (thoughts).

  When realizing by way of freedom from thoughts\
  This is conventionally labeled "seeing emptiness".\
  "Not seeing---that is seeing indeed"\
  So say the extremely profound sutras.\
  Here, there is no seeing and no one that sees.\
  There's no beginning or end. It is peace.\
  Entities and non-entities are relinquished,\
  It is thought-free, without focus.\
  There is no abiding and no abode,\
  Neither coming nor going, and without analogy.\
  Inexpressible and imperceptible,\
  It is unchanging, unconditioned.\
  When practitioners realize this,\
  They eradicate afflictive and cognitive obscurations.

The five wisdoms are now in full fruition, which includes non-referential wisdom of equality,
discernment, all-accomplishing, mirror-like, and dharmadhatu as a counterpart to the five
poisons and the reifications of conditioned mind.

The lucid, intuitive mind is no longer nascent, now in the forefront, fully actualized.

  Here there is no separation at all between the object of awareness and the knower who is aware;
  they are inseparable. Moreover, the observing awareness (_rig pa_) has no identifiable essence whatsoever.
  And that is why this is classified as the unity of awareness and emptiness.

  The true, and best, mode of liberation is where thoughts are liberated without benefit or harm,
  and this is compared to a thief breaking into an empty house. There is nothing for the thief
  to steal, nothing for an empty house to lose. Even though thought arises, it does so within
  the expanse of rigpa, and owing to the energy of rigpa. When it ceases, it ceases in and of itself.

Internal, external, day, and night are pure liberation.
There is complete freedom from the cycle of re-becoming, which includes
birth, sickness, injury, and death.
One is no longer bound to conditioned existence, traditionally called samsara,
or cyclic existence.
Due to the heart essence, benefit for beings still ensnared within illusory existence
is ensured.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @treasure-trove])[ // p.116
  Yogins who have realized the ultimate meaning of this great perfection in all its nakedness
  experience awareness, pure and simple, in all its nakedness. And so, while sense objects
  manifest in light of awareness, that awareness is not lost outwardly in response to those objects.
  Thus, dualistic perception, the root of samsara, is rendered null and void.
  As an indication that awareness, pure and simple, pristine in all its nakedness,
  is not lost in response to sense objects, there are no attachments to or fixations
  on sensory appearances, or attempts to suppress or indulge in them.
  Since samsara is as free as nirvana, we refer to "dharmakaya arising unobstructedly."

The decisive conclusion is complete freedom.
The mind is no longer bound by cognitive and emotional obscurations.
The very last cognitive obscurations have exhausted, including the apprehension
of emptiness.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Āryadeva's _Four Hundred Verses on the Middle Way_ @dalai-lama-dzogchen])[ // p.187
  The awareness that is the seed of existence,\
  Has objects as its sphere of activity,\
  When selflessness is seen in objects,\
  The seed of existence is destroyed.
