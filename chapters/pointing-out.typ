  There are a number of different viewpoints,\
  But in the present wakefulness, self-existing wisdom,\
  There is no duality between the viewer and that which is viewed.\
  So, do not watch the view, but look to the watcher.\
  When the watcher is not found after searching,\
  That is the time of bringing the view to the stage of exhaustion.

  This view without anything to be viewed,\
  Which has not strayed into a complete void and blank nothingness,\
  Is the present wakefulness, vivid and unfabricated.\
  This is precisely the view of the Great Perfection.

  Rest your mind loosely in naturalness and\
  See how the mind is when calm.\
  Observed, it rests calmly in the continuity of awareness.\
  Calm and yet empty, thus is the state of awareness.\
  Fortunate heart-children, you must understand this.\
  This is how calm resting is the mind's ornament.

  Give rise to a thought and observe how it arises.\
  Since it does not depart even in the slightest\
  From the state of empty and luminous awareness,\
  Arising and yet being empty is thus the state of awareness itself.
  Fortunate heart-children, you must understand this.\
  This is how arising is the play of the mind.

  To illustrate this, no matter how many waves may rise,\
  They never depart from the ocean even in the slightest.\
  Similarly, whether still or in movement,\
  The mind never departs from awareness and emptiness even in the slightest.\
  So rest, since whatever rests calmly is the state of awareness.\
  Rest, since whatever arises is the manifestation of awareness.

  // To believe that meditation is only when the mind rests quiet,\
  // And maintain that there is no meditation when the mind moves\
  // Is proof of not knowing the core of stillness and movement,\
  // And of not having mingled stillness, occurrence and awareness.

  // For this reason, fortunate and noble heart-children,\
  // Whether moving or still, mind is the continuity of awareness.
  // So, when you have fully comprehended stillness, occurrence, and awareness,\
  // Then practice these three as one.\
  // This is how stillness and thought occurrence are nondual.

==== #approval[Phet!]
Shouting _PHET!_, the practitioner utterly shocks conceptual mind.

The seed syllable _phet_ (Tib. ཕཊ, EWTS. _phaT_) is pronounced like the English word "pet"
with extra aspiration on the "p".

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, citing the _Reverberation of Sound_ @genuine-meaning])[ // p.239
  Let the mind become distracted and then shout a forceful _phet_,
  at which time cognition will become lucid and nonconceptual.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche @inborn-realization])[ // p.212
  When you are alone you can shout the PHET syllable, as taught by the great master
  Patrul Rinpoche in his famous Dzogchen teaching, _The Wise and Glorious King_.
  Shouting PHET instantly puts you in the natural state.
  It also wonderfully clarifies a dull and tired mind.

  First, relax your mind and stay there,\
  Neither elaborating nor concentrating,\
  Without discursive thought.

  While in the state relaxed and dwelling evenly,\
  Suddenly strike rational mind by exclaiming a PHAT---\
  Its force is delivered sharp and short, E MA HO!

  Nothing whatsoever, blankness;\
  Blankness has transparency;\
  The transparency's inexpressible.\
  Identify the dharmakaya rigpa!

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_The Flight of the Garuda_, Song 21 @flight-of-the-garuda-kunsang])[
  When people of lesser capacity cannot remain in the natural state,
  they should push thoughts to their breaking point,
  generating desirable or undesirable thoughts,
  in various ways, one after another,
  until their minds have become exhausted.
  Finally, not desiring to continue this further, they should rest loosely.

  _Direct introduction to awareness with the mind focused:_ Have the student sit
  cross-legged, breathing gently, with eyes wide open and mind resting without concepts.
  At that point, have the student disregard both the clarity and stability that are present
  when one abides in an extremely clear state of mind (for these are but meditative experiences),

  _Direct introduction to awareness with the mind at rest:_
  Without any focusing of his or her mind, but while it is very present and settled
  in its own place, have the student let go of its abiding quality, and directly

  _Direct introduction to awareness by getting to the root of the matter:_
  Have the student direct his or her attention inwardly, examining specifically
  where the mind comes from or is located. When (without anything actually being
  found) the mind becomes lucid in all its nakedness, have the student let go
  of the tendency to fall into some entirely nonconceptual state, and directly
  introduce naked wakefulness, beyond any label or meaning, as dharmakaya.

From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_ @treasure-trove:

#quote(block:true)[
  _Direct introduction to awareness through elimination of the sense that anything is real:_
  When the student's mind is lost in response to sense objects, have the student
  eliminate any sense of ordinary mind relating in some way to those objects ---
  for example, by reducing them to their components. When he or she is thus abiding in
  pristine emptiness, which is inexpressible and in which there is no sense of either
  objects or mind, have the student let go of that sense of abiding, in which there is
  no tendency whatsoever for thoughts to proliferate or resolve, and directly introduce
  the quality of awareness in all its pristine nakedness as dharmakaya.

#quote(block:true)[
  _Direct introduction to awareness in the gap between sense objects and consciousness of them:_
  Have the student rest contentedly while remaining conscious of a sense object. Then, without
  directing attention outwardly to the object or inwardly to the mind, he or she arrives at a
  seamless state of bare perception. Have the student let go of the sense of dwelling in that bare state,
  and directly introduce bare awareness, vivid and lucid, as dharmakaya.

From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_ @treasure-trove:

#quote(block:true)[
  _Direct introduction to awareness by inducing distraction:_
  Have the student spend a short time being idle; then deliberately cause him or her to
  become distracted by talking or whatever. At that point you might say,
  "What does 'harasaki' mean? Tell me! Tell me!" (A nonsense word.) Having no idea what it means,
  the student will experience mild astonishment and wonder. Then, have him or her let go of the sense
  of dwelling on that astonishment, and directly introduce the lucid wakefulness that is thus exposed
  as dharmakaya. Alternatively, you might say "Stay put!" when the student is on the point of going,
  or say "Go away!" only to say "Come back!" once he or she has gone a short distance.
  Then, have the student let go of what he or she experiences in turning back ---
  consciousness that is clear and involves no proliferation of thoughts ---
  and directly introduce the wakefulness thus exposed as dharmakaya.
