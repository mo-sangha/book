=== Pointing-Out Methods

==== Mind-to-Mind Reminder

The most direct method is a silent mind-to-mind reminder from an authentic awareness-realizer.

==== Looking into the Nature of Thought

When a thought arises, or when thoughts are proliferating, use awareness
to look into them. When they disappear, rest in that presence.
This is like water being poured into water, since awareness itself
is cognition looking into cognition.

==== Looking at the Watcher

Just like looking at a thought, there is a feeling of a watcher, an observer,
which can also be looked at with awareness.
This corresponds to the 7th aspect of consciousness in the Abhidhamma, known
as manas-vijnana.
When this aspect of consciousness settles in its own place, it's like water
being poured into water, since awareness is cognition looking at cognition.
When the watcher itself has exhausted,
simply settle into presence without effort as the way of abiding.

#quote(block:true, attribution: [_The Flight of the Garuda_, Song 19 @flight-of-the-garuda-kunsang])[ // p.70
  There are a number of different viewpoints,\
  But in the present wakefulness, self-existing wisdom,\
  There is no duality between the viewer and that which is viewed.\
  So, do not watch the view, but look to the watcher.\
  [...]
  // When the watcher is not found after searching,\
  // That is the time of bringing the view to the stage of exhaustion.

  This view without anything to be viewed,\
  Which has not strayed into a complete void and blank nothingness,\
  Is the present wakefulness, vivid and unfabricated.\
  This is precisely the view of the Great Perfection.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Padmasambhava @self-liberation-through-seeing])[
  // The method for entering into it involves three considerations:
  // 1. Thoughts in the past are clear and empty and leave no traces behind.
  // 2. Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.
  // 3. And in the present moment, when (your mind) remains in its own condition without constructing anything,
  //    awareness at that moment in itself is quite ordinary.

  And when you look into yourself in this way nakedly (without any discursive thoughts),
  since there is only this pure observing, there will be found a lucid clarity without
  anyone being there who is the observer; only a naked manifest awareness is present.
]

==== Being Aware of Awareness

This is the very simple act of noticing or recognizing ever-present awareness.
One can be seeing and be aware of awareness. Just like that, one can be thinking,
feeling, smelling, touching, etc. and be aware of awareness in the midst of these
experiences.

==== The Top and Bottom of the Breath

With a relaxed posture, breathing mindfully, pause at the top of the breath after inhalation,
then exhale, pausing at the bottom of the breath after every last bit of air has been released.

Rest in the presence at the bottom of the breath.

Bring that presence with you on your next inhalation.

This is the pure presence of mind.

==== The Space Between Thoughts

When doing a thought experiment, like thought isolation,
where we isolate a single thought within awareness,
 we can notice a thought coming and going.

Notice the space in which it comes.

Notice the space where thoughts are abiding.

Notice the space after it's gone.

Settle into natural luminosity.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Pema Karpo @lotsawa-casket])[
  The great Deshek of Kham said in his Mahamudra pointing-out instruction:

  Taking Mahamudra as something to be cultivated in meditation is mental fabrication.
  So how should you meditate? By settling in natural luminosity with no thoughts
  or habitual tendencies arising, and without contriving.
  This is how you will see your own nature.
]

==== Thinking As Many Thoughts As Possible
While in a relaxed posture, begin thinking as many thoughts as possible in rapid succession, to the point of exhaustion.

Here the conceptual mind gets crowded out to the point of silence as pure presence.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_The Flight of the Garuda_, Song 21 @flight-of-the-garuda-kunsang])[
  When people of lesser capacity cannot remain in the natural state,
  they should push thoughts to their breaking point,
  generating desirable or undesirable thoughts,
  in various ways, one after another,
  until their minds have become exhausted.
  Finally, not desiring to continue this further, they should rest loosely.
]

==== The Space Which Holds Stillness and Movement

Known in Dzogchen and Mahamudra as a technique for recognizing the nature of mind,
your Buddha-nature, the very space which holds the movement and stillness of mind
is the very basis for all experiences.

When you're having thoughts, awareness can be recognized.
When thoughts cease, awareness can also be recognized.
Therefore, it holds as the basis for stillness and movement.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [_The Flight of the Garuda_, Song 15 @flight-of-the-garuda-kunsang])[
  Rest your mind loosely in naturalness and\
  See how the mind is when calm.\
  Observed, it rests calmly in the continuity of awareness.\
  Calm and yet empty, thus is the state of awareness.\
  Fortunate heart-children, you must understand this.\
  This is how calm resting is the mind's ornament.

  Give rise to a thought and observe how it arises.\
  Since it does not depart even in the slightest\
  From the state of empty and luminous awareness,\
  Arising and yet being empty is thus the state of awareness itself.
  Fortunate heart-children, you must understand this.\
  This is how arising is the play of the mind.

  To illustrate this, no matter how many waves may rise,\
  They never depart from the ocean even in the slightest.\
  Similarly, whether still or in movement,\
  The mind never departs from awareness and emptiness even in the slightest.\
  So rest, since whatever rests calmly is the state of awareness.\
  Rest, since whatever arises is the manifestation of awareness.

  // To believe that meditation is only when the mind rests quiet,\
  // And maintain that there is no meditation when the mind moves\
  // Is proof of not knowing the core of stillness and movement,\
  // And of not having mingled stillness, occurrence and awareness.

  // For this reason, fortunate and noble heart-children,\
  // Whether moving or still, mind is the continuity of awareness.
  // So, when you have fully comprehended stillness, occurrence, and awareness,\
  // Then practice these three as one.\
  // This is how stillness and thought occurrence are nondual.

==== Phet
Shouting _PHET!_, a fierce exclamation of the seed syllable, immediately stops the flow
of thoughts, stops emotional activity, and brings the practitioner directly into the pure presence
of their enlightened mind.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, citing the _Reverberation of Sound_ @genuine-meaning])[ // p.239
  Let the mind become distracted and then shout a forceful _phet_,
  at which time cognition will become lucid and nonconceptual.
]

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche @inborn-realization])[ // p.212
  When you are alone you can shout the PHET syllable, as taught by the great master
  Patrul Rinpoche in his famous Dzogchen teaching, _The Wise and Glorious King_.
  Shouting PHET instantly puts you in the natural state.
  It also wonderfully clarifies a dull and tired mind.
