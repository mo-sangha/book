==== Describing Awareness
From Dorje Lekpa, who learned this from Eric L:

In whatever state of mind, speak aloud a spontaneous description of your
current experience of awareness. Speak only about awareness itself,
not about the objective content of awareness.
Speak from your actual present experience of awareness, not from memory.

For example: "Awareness is spacious," "Awareness does not change,"
"Awareness is a luminous clarity," or "Awareness is like a trust fall."


Describe awareness in this way over and over again, never repeating a description,
always finding a fresh way to describe it. If it seems you've run out of descriptions,
keep going.

This method can also be done in a group setting, taking turns.


==== PoD: Mind in Stillness // pp.74-75
From Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche@pointing-out-dharmakaya:

Allow your mind to come to rest in the state of shamatha.
Then look at the mind in that state while continuing to rest in the mind
or while looking at the mind.

// The source text obviously has a bunch more elaborate explanation of details.

==== RoS: Focusing the Mind // Treasure Trove, p.177
From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_@treasure-trove:

_Direct introduction to awareness with the mind focused:_ Have the student sit
cross-legged, breathing gently, with eyes wide open and mind resting without concepts.
At that point, have the student disregard both the clarity and stability that are present
when one abides in an extremely clear state of mind (for these are but meditative experiences),
and directly introduce the naked wakefulness of awareness as dharmakaya.


==== RoS: Letting the Mind Rest // Treasure Trove, p.177
From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_@treasure-trove:

_Direct introduction to awareness with the mind at rest:_
Without any focusing of his or her mind, but while it is very present and settled
in its own place, have the student let go of its abiding quality, and directly
introduce lucid wakefulness as dharmakaya.


==== RoS: Getting to the Root of the Matter // Treasure Trove, p.177
From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_@treasure-trove:

_Direct introduction to awareness by getting to the root of the matter:_
Have the student direct his or her attention inwardly, examining specifically
where the mind comes from or is located. When (without anything actually being
found) the mind becomes lucid in all its nakedness, have the student let go
of the tendency to fall into some entirely nonconceptual state, and directly
introduce naked wakefulness, beyond any label or meaning, as dharmakaya.


==== RoS: Eliminating the Sense of Reality // Treasure Trove, p.177
From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_@treasure-trove:

_Direct introduction to awareness through elimination of the sense that anything is real:_
When the student's mind is lost in response to sense objects, have the student
eliminate any sense of ordinary mind relating in some way to those objects ---
for example, by reducing them to their components. When he or she is thus abiding in
pristine emptiness, which is inexpressible and in which there is no sense of either
objects or mind, have the student let go of that sense of abiding, in which there is
no tendency whatsoever for thoughts to proliferate or resolve, and directly introduce
the quality of awareness in all its pristine nakedness as dharmakaya.


==== RoS: The Gap Between Objects and Consciousness // Treasure Trove, pp.177-178
From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_@treasure-trove:

_Direct introduction to awareness in the gap between sense objects and consciousness of them:_
Have the student rest contentedly while remaining conscious of a sense object. Then, without
directing attention outwardly to the object or inwardly to the mind, he or she arrives at a
seamless state of bare perception. Have the student let go of the sense of dwelling in that bare state,
and directly introduce bare awareness, vivid and lucid, as dharmakaya.


==== RoS: Inducing Distraction // Treasure Trove, p.178
From Longchenpa's explanation of the _Reverberation of Sound_@treasure-trove:

_Direct introduction to awareness by inducing distraction:_
Have the student spend a short time being idle; then deliberately cause him or her to
become distracted by talking or whatever. At that point you might say,
"What does 'harasaki' mean? Tell me! Tell me!" (A nonsense word.) Having no idea what it means,
the student will experience mild astonishment and wonder. Then, have him or her let go of the sense
of dwelling on that astonishment, and directly introduce the lucid wakefulness that is thus exposed
as dharmakaya. Alternatively, you might say "Stay put!" when the student is on the point of going,
or say "Go away!" only to say "Come back!" once he or she has gone a short distance.
Then, have the student let go of what he or she experiences in turning back ---
consciousness that is clear and involves no proliferation of thoughts ---
and directly introduce the wakefulness thus exposed as dharmakaya.


==== Zen: Alert Observation // Kensho, p.15
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When doing the inner work, you always cut off thoughts and prevent thoughts from arising.
The instant a thought arises, you immediately break through it by awakeness.
When errant thoughts are broken through by awakeness, following thoughts do not arise;
then you no longer need this wakening knowledge.
When confusion and awakening are both forgotten, this is called mindlessness.

Therefore a master teacher said, "Do not fear thoughts' arising; just be wary of being slow
to become aware of it." There is also a verse that says, "You do not need to seek reality,
just stop entertaining views and opinions." This is working on stopping illusion by
alert observation.


==== Zen: Cessation // Kensho, p. 16
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, do not think of good or bad. When the mind is aroused, stop right away;
when you encounter objects, cease and desist.

An ancient said, "Be like a piece of white silk;
be cool; be like the censer in an abandoned temple." Then you are free from vagueness and
detached from false discrimination. Be like an ignoramus or a dunce, and then you will attain
some accord. This is working on stopping illusion by putting the mind to rest.


==== Zen: Mind Disappears, Objects Remain // Kensho, p.16
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, stop all random thoughts. Paying no attention to external objects, you just stop your own mind.
Once the errant mind has stopped, what is the harm if there are objects there?
This is the ancient teaching of "taking away the subject but not the objects."

Thus there is a saying, "Here there is fragrant grass, but no old friends in the city."
Also, lay master P'ang said, "Just have no mind on anything, and what does it matter
if everything surrounds you?" This is working on stopping delusion by having mind
disappear while letting objects remain.


==== Zen: Objects Disappear, Mind Remains // Kensho, p.16
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, you view all objects, both internal and external, as totally null and void,
just keeping one mind alone and independent. Thus an ancient said,
"Don't be a partner to myriad things, don't relate to the sense data."
If mind sticks to objects, the mind is confused; now if there are no objects,
what confusion can there be? Then the true mind shines alone, not obstructed from the Way.
This is what an ancient master teacher called removing objects but not the subject.

Thus it is said, "Going into the garden, you find the flowers have already fallen;
but horses and carriages still fill the place." It is also said, "Three thousand warriors ---
where are they now? I only consider Chuang-tzu able to establish great peace."
This is working on stopping delusion by letting objects disappear while mind remains.


==== Zen: Mind and Objects Both Disappear // Kensho, p.17
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, first you make external objects empty and silent, then you extinguish your inner mind.
Since inner mind and outer objects are both silent, ultimately where can confusion come from?

Therefore an ancient master said, "There are no walls in the ten directions, no gates in the four quarters."
You are clean and naked, bare and untrammeled. This is the ancient masters' teaching of simultaneously
removing both subject and object. There is a saying in reference to this that goes,
"The clouds have dispersed, the water run off; profoundly silent, heaven and earth are empty."
There is also a saying, "When the herder and the ox have both disappeared, this is precisely
when the moon is bright and clear." This is working on stopping delusion by making
mind and objects both disappear.


==== Zen: Leaving Mind and Objects There // Kensho, p.17
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, mind abides in the normal state of mind, objects abide in the normal state of objects.
Whenever mind and objects face each other, mind does not grasp objects and objects do not rule the mind;
neither actually reaches the other, so confused thoughts naturally do not arise,
and there is no hindrance to the Way.

Therefore scripture says, "These phenomena abide in the normal state of phenomena; the characteristics
of the world are always there." This is teaching of removing neither subject nor object,
of which it is said, "When the single moon rises over the ocean, how many people go upstairs to see it!"
It is also said, "Amid the myriad mountain flowers, the wanderer does not know the way back."
This is working on extinguishing delusion while leaving objects and mind there.


==== Zen: Total Substance, Inside and Out // Kensho, p.17
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, you realize that all things --- the mountains, rivers, earth, sun, moon, stars,
and planets, the inner body and outer world --- are the same as the substance of the true mind.
Profoundly calm, open and clear, there is not the slightest difference.
The whole universe becomes one; then where do you find the confused mind?

Thus dharma master Seng Chao said, "Heaven, earth, and I have the same root; all things
and I are the same body." This is working on destroying delusion by the total substance
of inside and outside.


==== Zen: Total Function, Inner and Outer // Kensho, p.18
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, you view all things, internal and external --- body, mind, and the material world,
including all doings and activities --- as marvelous functions of the true mind.
The instant they arise, all thoughts in the mind are manifestations of miraculous function.
Since it is all miraculous function, where can the confused mind rest?

Therefore Yung-chia said, "The real nature of ignorance is Buddha-nature; the illusory
empty body is the body of reality." In Master Pao-chih's Twelve Hour Verses, he wrote,
"At dawn, wild potential hides within a wayfarer's body; sitting, lying down, he doesn't know
it's originally the Way. In such a hurry, he feels bitter pain."
This is working on stopping delusion by total inner and outer function.


==== Zen: Substance Identical to Function // Kensho, p.18
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, even though you subtly merge with reality and there is uniform emptiness
and silence, nevertheless effective luminosity is concealed therein, so the substance
is identical to the function. Within effective luminosity, there is concealed empty silence,
so the function is identical to the substance.

Therefore Yung-chia said, "Alert tranquility is right, indifferent tranquility is wrong."
Since indifference is not allowed in tranquility, and random thoughts are not used in alertness,
where can any confused mind come from? This is working on destroying delusion by the
identity of substance and function.


==== Zen: Passing Through and Beyond Substance and Function // Kensho, p.18
From Chinul's _Straightforward Explanation of the True Mind_@kensho:

When you work, you do not divide inside from outside, and do not distinguish
east, west, south, north: you take the four quarters and eight directions and just make
it all into one big door of liberation. In this perfect roundness, substance and function
are not divided. There is not the slightest leak, the whole being is one.
Where can confusion arise?

An ancient said, "The whole being is seamless; above and below, all is one sphere."
This is working on destroying delusion by passing through and beyond substance and function.
