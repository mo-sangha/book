// Recognition: Discerning the Implications (section intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

You are taking the pure aspect of mind, awareness, as the path, traditionally called "taking the fruit as the path."

The implications of this pointing out are that you now have a foundation for self-liberation. You have broken free of karmic practices
and the conceptual mind, taking awareness as the path.

(Here I'd like to make citations like Garab Dorje's statements and things emphasizing self-liberation)
