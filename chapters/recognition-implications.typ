// Recognition: Discerning the Implications (section intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

You are taking the pure aspect of mind, awareness, as the path, traditionally called "taking the fruit as the path."

The implications of this pointing out are that you now have a foundation for self-liberation. You have broken free of karmic practices
and the conceptual mind, taking awareness as the path.

  Conceptualization is the ultimate nonrecognition of awareness.\
  It causes one to fall into the ocean of samsara.

  _The Compendium_ states:

  However many beings there are, whether inferior, middling, or superior,
  the Sugata has stated that they all come from the nonrecognition of awareness.

  The world of myriad ways in which beings perceive---and
  even the kayas and timeless awareness of pure buddhahood---all
  that permeates the realm of basic space as a continuous display
  arises due to dynamic energy, either in light of realization or in its absence.

  There is simply realization or its lack within the realm of the basic space of phenomena.
  For those with realization, who have reached a state of bliss, there is pure perception.
  For those without it, there is nonrecognition of awareness and the habitual patterns
  of dualistic perception,
  from which sensory appearances manifest in all their variety,
  though none of this strays from basic space.
