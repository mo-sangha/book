// The Four Chokshyaks
#import "../template.typ": *

The "fourfold freely resting," or the "four ways of leaving things as they are"
(Tib. ཅོག་བཞག་རྣམ་བཞི་, Wyl. _cog bzhag rnam bzhi_).

// Keith Dowman has an excellent description in the "Freely Resting" section of the Yeshe Lama.
// Lama Chönam's translation is on p. 39.
// However, Dowman is adamant that no section of the book be copied, and we should respect that.
