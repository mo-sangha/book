// The Four Chokshyaks
#import "../template.typ": *

The "fourfold freely resting," or the "four ways of leaving things as they are"
(Tib. ཅོག་བཞག་རྣམ་བཞི་, Wyl. _cog bzhag rnam bzhi_).

1. View, like a mountain: leave it as-it-is.
2. Meditation, like an ocean: leave it as-it-is.
3. Action, appearances: leave them as they are.
4. Fruition, unaltered: leave it as-it-is.

// Keith Dowman has an excellent description in the "Freely Resting" section of the Yeshe Lama.
// Lama Chönam's translation is on p. 39.
// However, Dowman is adamant that no section of the book be copied, and we should respect that.
