  Shantideva said, "Unless you know the secret key point, whatever you do will miss the mark."
  The secret key point of mind is that its nature is a self-existing, original wakefulness.
  To identify the key point we need to receive the pointing-out instruction.

=== The Practitioner is Pointed to the Nature of Mind

If pointing out to awareness "as the nature of mind" is successful then there will be an "Ah-ha!" moment,
even if it's very subtle. Like noticing something that has always been there, we can discern an acknowledgment.
The recognition could also settle in like an emotional "Ah-ha!", but it's undeniable when one
has recognized naked awareness.

There are many indicators we may use for evidence to verify recognition.
Beings typically immediately apprehend this recognition, and without guidance could delay
their familiarization for a significant time. "Apprehend" means we're not leaving it alone
as naked awareness but we form concepts, tell stories about awareness, and lay claim to awareness
as typical patterned tendencies get mingled in.
This is why we have a second phase, which is to familiarize with the recognition.

The key point here as the trekcho aspect is that practitioners are pointed to
awareness as the nature of mind, permeating all experiences.

The togal aspect
involves introduction to clear light but also to light rays, bindus, and vajra chains,
which are mind-light phenomena seen by conditioned mind, thereby bridging
the conditioned mind with pure luminous mind.
Then conditioned mind is essentially turning in on itself, like water pouring into water,
as mind recognizing mind.

This first phase corresponds to the first of Garab Dorje's three statements:
"Introducing directly the face of rigpa itself."
If the practitioner notices bindus (small light spheres within rays) with togal introduction,
then it corresponds with the first togal vision.

In Mahayana context, this phase corresponds with the 3rd of the 5 paths as stated by Patrul Rinpoche:

  The path of seeing is so called because it is the stage at which we first see
  the supermundane wisdom of the noble ones.
]

In phase 1 we are introduced to the fruit (11th bhumi) as the path.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Jigme Lingpa @lotsawa-directly-seeing])[
  The essential point of the Great Perfection is this clear, naked awareness---our mind,
  right now, unaltered, relaxed, and without even the slightest change. And that's it.

//   The three phases of things arising, abiding, and being freed do not take place

//   "their own place" refers to bare awareness abiding as naked original purity

//   refers to recognition of this.
// ]

#quote(block: true, attribution: [His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama @dalai-lama-dzogchen])[ // p.69
  So, in this present case the view is where you are introduced directly to rigpa,
  and you practice by maintaining that recognition. If you have already gained direct
  introduction to rigpa, you do not necessarily have to go through the preliminary
  of examining the arising, remaining, and ceasing of thoughts to reveal
  "the mind's hidden flaw," and so arrive at a decisive conclusion about it.
  In the Madhyamaka approach of the sutra tradition, however, all of these steps are necessary.

== Discerning the Implications
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You are taking the pure aspect of mind, awareness, as the path,
traditionally called "taking the fruit as the path."

The implications of this pointing out are that you now have a foundation for self-liberation.
You have broken free of karmic practices and the conceptual mind, taking awareness as the path.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Dignaga @treasure-trove])[
  Conceptualization is the ultimate nonrecognition of awareness.\
  It causes one to fall into the ocean of samsara.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @treasure-trove])[ // p.28
  _The Compendium_ states:

  However many beings there are, whether inferior, middling, or superior,
  the Sugata has stated that they all come from the nonrecognition of awareness.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa, _The Basic Space of Phenomena_ @basic-space])[
  The world of myriad ways in which beings perceive---and
  even the kayas and timeless awareness of pure buddhahood---all
  that permeates the realm of basic space as a continuous display
  arises due to dynamic energy, either in light of realization or in its absence.

  There is simply realization or its lack within the realm of the basic space of phenomena.
  For those with realization, who have reached a state of bliss, there is pure perception.
  For those without it, there is nonrecognition of awareness and the habitual patterns
  of dualistic perception,
  from which sensory appearances manifest in all their variety,
  though none of this strays from basic space.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Embracing the Larger Scope
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In our approach, this recognition sets the precedent and premise for all further engagement,
including effortlessness and familiarization with your whole mind as the heart essence.

Here we are introduced to ultimate wisdom and compassion, bodhicitta, which in turn blossoms with familiarization
while karmic conditioning is self-liberated.

Even if the practitioner only has a slight glimpse, they are introduced to their enlightened
mind and to the four great Dzogchen samayas. They have fully recognized empty cognizance.

Although true recognition has been ensured, in many cases the view will be apprehended by conditioned mind.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Coming to the Decisive Conclusion
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You have recognized the nature of mind and are ready to move to phase 2.

You are comfortable enough in your recognition to begin familiarizing with the nature
of mind, departing from conditioned reality.
Since recognition has occurred, now cognitive diffusion, or the unbinding of mind, can take place.

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Longchenpa @treasure-trove])[
  With respect to the very essence of timeless awareness, free of elaboration,
  as things arise due to its dynamic energy it is possible to identify awareness
  in all its pristine nakedness, without the reifying effect of concepts---without
  investigating anything outwardly, examining anything inwardly, or deliberately settling
  in between these alternatives. This awareness is realized to be nothing other than
  that very essence, free of elaboration, experienced in all its nakedness.
  Thus, it is nondual, naturally occurring timeless awareness.
