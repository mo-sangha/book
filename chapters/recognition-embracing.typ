// Recognition: Embracing the Larger Scope (section intro)
#import "../template.typ": *

In our approach, this recognition sets the precedent and premise for all further engagement,
including effortlessness and familiarization with your whole mind as the heart essence.


Here we are introduced to ultimate wisdom and compassion, bodhicitta, which in turn blossoms with familiarization
while karmic conditioning is self-liberated.


Even if the practitioner only has a slight glimpse, they are introduced to their enlightened
mind and to the four great Dzogchen samayas. They have fully recognized empty cognizance.

Although true recognition has been ensured, in many cases the view will be apprehended by conditioned mind.
