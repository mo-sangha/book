#no_outline[= Foreword]

This text is mainly created to accompany practitioners of the Meditation Online
style of Dzogchen but can be used by all kinds of practitioners.

At Meditation Online we have live sessions twice a day, which facilitate the four phases with
short sessions, inquiry discussions, and text/media explorations.
These correspond with secret, inner, and outer aspects of the view.

Much of this text is meant to be accompanied by a teacher, teachings, and group of practitioners.
The style deals with recognition of the nature of mind, post-recognition, and release into complete freedom.
The three kayas as essence, nature, and energy become revealed using practices passed through
timeless traditions.

This text is part of an unbroken lineage of awareness-realizers.
The approach of "four phases" spontaneously came together from two years of group practice.
Everything here is based on real accounts from practitioners, actual introspection,
peer reviewed and verified for authenticity in an honest, open, and safe environment.

Our approach has fused with much of traditional Buddhadharma, utilizing foundational aspects
like the eight consciousness model, five wisdoms, and much more.

Inspired to help practitioners all over the world, a very simple truth is outlined here for direct access.

May all beings benefit!
